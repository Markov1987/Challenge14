## Overview of the analysis

We are using New York's bicycle riding information to identify habits that may show how this model can be replicated in a new market. For this purpose, we analyzed August information as the month with more usage during the year.

NY City August information showed 2.3 million trips with over 83% of subscribers with most of the trips starting at New York's financial district.
